   <p class="bold"> What are the symptoms of COVID-19?:</p>
        <p> Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu.</p>
 <p>  Symptoms have included: </p>
             <li>cough</li>
             <li>fever</li>
             <li>difficulty breathing</li>
              <li>pneumonia in both lungs</li>
 <p>In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.</p>
            
 <p>Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who: </p>  
            
        <li>have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)</li>
             <li>never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)</li>
             
   <p> While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures. </p>          
            
            
            
            
 <p class="bold">Is there a vaccine or therapy that can treat or prevent COVID-19?:</p>
<p>Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own. If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.</p>
<p>If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses.

At this time, a vaccine or therapy to treat or prevent this disease has not yet been developed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices used to diagnose, treat or prevent COVID-19.</p>


            
            
   <p class="bold">I am feeling stressed and overwhelmed. What can I do to care for my mental health?:</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes. You might feel like you're no longer in control of things. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried. People react in different ways. Some common feelings include:</p>
        
         <li>a sense of being socially excluded or judged</li>
             <li>concern about your children's education and well-being</li>
             <li>fear of getting sick with COVID-19 or of making others sick</li>
              <li>worry about losing your job, not being able to work or finances</li>      
             <li>fear of being apart from loved ones due to isolation or physical distancing</li>  
             <li>helplessness, boredom, loneliness and depression due to isolation or physical distancing</li>  
            
        <p>If you need help, you can call:</p>
      <li>your primary health provider</li>
             <li>a registered psychologist</li>
            <li>another mental health provider in your community</li>
