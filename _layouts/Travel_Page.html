   <p class="bold"> Are Canadians currently able to travel to the U.S.?:</p>
        <p>As of April 22, 2020, the 30-day restriction on all non-essential (discretionary) travel at the Canada-U.S. border that was implemented on March 21, 2020, was extended for an additional 30 days until May 21, 2020. This applies to all foreign nationals, including immediate family members, such as spouses/partners. Potential travellers should consult the Border Information Service for information. </p>
        <p> Examples of discretionary/ optional (non-essential) travel include:</p>
          
       <li>tourism</li>
            <li>recreation</li>
            <li>entertainment</li>
            
          <p> If you are healthy and must cross the border for work or other non-discretionary (essential) purposes, you may continue to do so. Some examples of essential travel purposes are:</p>  
           <li>work and study</li>
            <li>critical infrastructure support</li>
            <li>economic services and supply chains</li> 
      <li>shopping for essential goods</li>
            <li>health, immediate medical care, safety and security</li> 
            
            <p>
              Some persons working in the health care field are considered exempt from the border prohibition. This is the case as long as they do not provide direct care for people over 65 years of age within the first 14 days of their entry into Canada.
            </p>
            
            
            
 <p> If you are a foreign national arriving from the U.S. with symptoms of COVID-19, you will not be allowed to enter Canada.

Foreign nationals arriving from the U.S. without symptoms of COVID-19, will be allowed to enter Canada only for essential travel.

Foreign nationals, excluding those arriving from the U.S., will not be allowed into Canada. However, there are exemptions to these restrictions for foreign nationals arriving from other countries.</p>
            
    <p> If you are not Canadian or a permanent resident and you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to enter Canada.

If you show signs of an infectious disease, officials will contact a quarantine officer.</p>          
            
       
            
            
            
            
 <p class="bold">I have recently returned from a trip outside of Canada and I have symptoms. What do I need to do?:</p>
<p>If you are Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you may still enter Canada by land, rail or sea. You may not enter Canada by air, to protect the health of all travellers.

If you need it, we will provide you with immediate medical attention when you arrive in Canada.

  If you have symptoms, you must isolate for 14 days. This is mandatory.</p>
            
            <li>You must isolate in a place where you will not have contact with vulnerable people</li>
                <li>You will need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you will have access to basic necessities, such as food and medication</li>
                <li>You must use private transportation (such as your own vehicle) to get to your place of isolation</li>
                <li>You must wear a non-medical mask or face covering while traveling to your place of isolation</li>
            <p>
              If you do not have private transportation or an adequate place to isolate, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada will designate a facility where you must isolate for 14 days.
            </p>
  


     <p class="bold">I have recently returned from a trip outside of Canada and I do not have any symptoms. What do I need to do?:</p>        
      <p>
        If you have recently returned to Canada and you have no symptoms, you must quarantine (self-isolate) for 14 days. This is mandatory. You are at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.
            </p>
     
            <li>You must quarantine (self-isolate) in a place where you will have no contact with vulnerable people</li>
            <li>You will need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you will have access to basic necessities, such as food and medication.</li>
             <li>You must wear a non-medical mask or face covering while traveling to the place you will quarantine (self-isolate).</li>
            <p>
              If you do not have an adequate place to quarantine (self-isolate), the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada will designate a facility where you must remain for 14 days.
